# Chat Enhancements Master Implementation Plan

## Overview
This master plan outlines the implementation of several key enhancements to the chat interface:
1. LLM Model Selector
2. Document Artifact System
3. Chat Privacy and Participant Management

Each feature has its own detailed implementation plan, and this master plan provides a high-level overview and integration strategy.

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Foundation (Weeks 1-2)
- Implement core types and interfaces for all features
- Create basic UI components for model selection
- Implement document preview component
- Add privacy selector component
- Update chat interface to accommodate new controls

### Phase 2: Core Functionality (Weeks 3-4)
- Complete LLM model selector with Ollama integration
- Implement document view and editing components
- Add participant management functionality
- Update server-side handlers for all features
- Integrate with existing chat system

### Phase 3: Advanced Features (Weeks 5-6)
- Implement document suggestions and polishing
- Add advanced model selection capabilities
- Enhance privacy controls and access management
- Implement response voting functionality
- Add comprehensive error handling

### Phase 4: Integration and Polish (Weeks 7-8)
- Ensure consistent neumorphic design across all components
- Optimize performance for large documents
- Implement comprehensive testing
- Add final polish and refinements
- Complete documentation

## Feature Dependencies

### LLM Model Selector
- Depends on existing LLM key management system
- Required for document generation quality

### Document Artifact System
- Depends on LLM model selector for generation quality
- Core feature that enables other artifact types

### Chat Privacy and Participant Management
- Independent feature that can be implemented in parallel
- Enhances overall chat experience

## Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for individual components
- Integration tests for feature combinations
- End-to-end tests for complete workflows
- Performance testing for large documents and complex chats

### Week 4
- Complete model selector component
- Implement document agent
- Add privacy management API
- Integrate all components with chat interface

### Week 5
- Add document polishing tool
- Enhance model selection capabilities
- Implement participant management API
