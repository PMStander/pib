# AI Chat Interface Implementation Plan

## Context
This document outlines the plan for implementing an AI chat interface that will allow users to interact with the vector search functionality using natural language.

## Goals
- Create a user-friendly chat interface for interacting with the system
- Implement natural language processing for query understanding
- Integrate with the vector search functionality
- Generate helpful responses based on search results
- Provide a conversational experience for partner matching

## Implementation Plan

### 1. Chat UI Component
- Create a `ChatInterface.vue` component with the following features:
  - Chat message display area
  - Message input field
  - Send button
  - Loading indicator
  - Message bubbles for user and AI messages
  - Support for rich content in AI responses (e.g., profile cards, business cards)
  - Responsive design for mobile and desktop

### 2. Chat State Management
- Create a `useChat` composable with the following features:
  - Message history storage
  - Message sending functionality
  - Integration with vector search
  - Message processing pipeline
  - Response generation
  - Error handling

### 3. Natural Language Processing
- Implement query understanding using the following approach:
  - Extract intent from user messages (e.g., search profiles, match business)
  - Extract entities from user messages (e.g., skills, industries, locations)
  - Map intents to vector search functions
  - Handle follow-up questions and context

### 4. Response Generation
- Implement response generation with the following features:
  - Format search results as natural language responses
  - Include relevant information from search results
  - Provide explanations for matches
  - Suggest follow-up questions
  - Handle edge cases (no results, errors)

### 5. Integration with Vector Search
- Integrate the chat interface with the vector search functionality:
  - Call appropriate search functions based on user intent
  - Pass extracted entities as search parameters
  - Process search results for response generation
  - Handle errors and edge cases

### 6. Testing and Refinement
- Test the chat interface with various scenarios:
  - Simple search queries
  - Complex search queries
  - Follow-up questions
  - Edge cases (no results, errors)
  - Refine the implementation based on test results

## Implementation Steps

1. **Create Chat UI Component**
   - Create `components/chat/ChatInterface.vue`
   - Implement chat message display
   - Implement message input field
   - Add styling for chat bubbles
   - Add loading indicator

2. **Create Chat State Management**
   - Create `composables/useChat.ts`
   - Implement message history storage
   - Implement message sending functionality
   - Add basic response generation

3. **Implement Natural Language Processing**
   - Create `utils/nlp.ts` for query understanding
   - Implement intent extraction
   - Implement entity extraction
   - Map intents to vector search functions

4. **Implement Response Generation**
   - Create `utils/responseGenerator.ts`
   - Implement response templates
   - Add logic for formatting search results
   - Handle edge cases

5. **Integrate with Vector Search**
   - Update `useChat.ts` to call vector search functions
   - Process search results for response generation
   - Add error handling

6. **Create Chat Page**
   - Create `pages/chat.vue`
   - Integrate ChatInterface component
   - Add navigation to chat page
   - Add authentication check

7. **Test and Refine**
   - Test with various scenarios
   - Refine implementation based on test results
   - Add additional features as needed

## Timeline
- Chat UI Component: 1 day
- Chat State Management: 1 day
- Natural Language Processing: 2 days
- Response Generation: 2 days
- Integration with Vector Search: 1 day
- Testing and Refinement: 2 days

## Success Criteria
- Users can interact with the system using natural language
- The system correctly understands user intent and extracts relevant entities
- The system provides helpful responses based on search results
- The chat interface is user-friendly and responsive
- The system handles errors and edge cases gracefully

## Dependencies
- Vector search functionality
- Authentication system
- UI components (neumorphic design system)

## Risks and Mitigations
- **Risk**: Natural language processing may not accurately understand user intent
  - **Mitigation**: Implement fallback mechanisms and clarification prompts

- **Risk**: Response generation may not provide helpful information
  - **Mitigation**: Create templates for different response types and test with various scenarios

- **Risk**: Integration with vector search may be complex
  - **Mitigation**: Create a clear interface between the chat system and vector search

- **Risk**: Performance issues with large datasets
  - **Mitigation**: Implement pagination and optimize search queries
