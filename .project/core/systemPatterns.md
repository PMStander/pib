# System Patterns

## Context
This document outlines the architecture and design patterns used in the "Partners in Biz" application.

## Architecture Overview
The application follows a modern web architecture based on the Nuxt.js framework, which implements the Vue.js component-based approach. The architecture consists of the following layers:

1. **Presentation Layer**
   - Vue.js components for UI elements
   - Nuxt.js layouts for page structure
   - Tailwind CSS for styling

2. **Application Layer**
   - Vue.js composables for reusable logic
   - Nuxt.js pages for routing
   - State management using Vue's Composition API

3. **Data Layer**
   - API integration for backend communication
   - Local storage for client-side data persistence
   - Data models for consistent data structure

## Design Patterns

### Component Pattern
- Reusable UI components with clear responsibilities
- Component composition for complex UI elements
- Props and events for component communication

### Composition Pattern
- Use of Vue.js Composition API for logic organization
- Composables for shared functionality
- Separation of concerns within components

### Repository Pattern
- Centralized data access through repository services
- Abstraction of API calls and data manipulation
- Consistent error handling and data transformation

### Responsive Design Pattern
- Mobile-first approach using Tailwind CSS
- Responsive components that adapt to different screen sizes
- Consistent user experience across devices

### Neumorphic Design Pattern
- Soft UI approach with subtle shadows and highlights
- Consistent color palette with light/dark shadow pairs
- Multiple effect variants (flat, pressed, concave, convex)
- Accessible and responsive neumorphic components

## Coding Standards
- Follow Vue.js style guide recommendations
- Use TypeScript for type safety
- Implement consistent naming conventions
- Write unit tests for critical functionality

## Performance Considerations
- Implement lazy loading for components and routes
- Optimize asset loading and caching
- Use server-side rendering for improved SEO and initial load performance
- Implement code splitting to reduce bundle size
