4. Continue implementing vector search capabilities for AI-data interaction

## Session Summary (2024-05-06)
In this session, we first migrated from Firebase DataConnect to Firestore due to persistent emulator issues, and then analyzed the server-side data management system to understand how to integrate it with our client-side code.

### Key Observations:
1. DataConnect Emulator Issues:
   - DataConnect emulator was crashing with SIGINT signals
   - Multiple attempts to fix the emulator issues were unsuccessful
   - Port mismatch between firebase.json (9499) and useFirebase.ts (9498) was identified but fixing it didn't resolve the issues

2. Server-Side Data Management:
   - The application has a robust server-side API for CRUD operations
   - Authentication tokens from Firebase need to be passed to the server
   - Vector search capabilities are implemented through embedding generation
   - Session management is handled through cookies

3. Implementation Approach:
   - Created a new useFirestore.ts composable that implements the same functionality as useDataConnect.ts
   - Updated useDataConnect.ts to serve as a compatibility layer that uses useFirestore.ts internally
   - Added vector search capability to both composables
   - Documented the server-side data management system for future reference

## Session Summary (2024-05-04)
In this session, we fixed authentication issues in the chat page and workspaces display issues in the workspaces tab. We also implemented an AI chat interface for interacting with the vector search functionality.

### Key Observations:
1. Authentication Issues:
   - The chat page was using onMounted to check authentication, which was too late
   - The workspaces page was using a local ref with mock data instead of app state
   - Different pages had inconsistent approaches to authentication handling

2. Implementation Challenges:
   - Ensuring consistent state management across pages
   - Fixing timing issues with data fetching
   - Integrating the chat interface with the vector search functionality

3. Implementation Approach:
   - Standardized authentication handling across pages
   - Used computed properties to access app state consistently
   - Added proper data fetching sequence to ensure data is available
   - Created a modular architecture for the chat interface

### Implementation Details:
1. Authentication Fixes:
   - Updated the chat page to use conditional rendering for authentication checks
   - Fixed the workspaces page to use the app state for workspaces data
   - Added proper data fetching in both pages
   - Improved error handling and loading states

2. Chat Interface Implementation:
   - Created a responsive chat interface with message bubbles
   - Implemented a useChat composable for managing chat state

3. Navigation and Layout:
   - Created a MainNavigation component for easy access to all pages
   - Updated the default layout to include the navigation
   - Ensured responsive design for mobile and desktop
   - Added proper loading states and error handling

## Current State
The application has been fully migrated from Firebase DataConnect to Firestore for data storage and vector search capabilities. All database operations now go through server API endpoints (`/api/data/write`, `/api/data/read`, `/api/data/update`) which enhances security by ensuring proper authentication and validation.

Vector search has been implemented in two ways:
1. **Client-side**: Using a placeholder implementation in the server API that works with the client-side SDK
2. **Server-side**: Using Firebase Cloud Functions that leverage the Admin SDK's findNearest method

The server-side implementation provides proper vector search capabilities using Firestore's findNearest method with cosine similarity, allowing for semantic search across profiles, businesses, and partner preferences. The client-side implementation serves as a fallback when Cloud Functions are not available.

We've also implemented a client-side composable (useCloudFunctions.ts) for interacting with the Cloud Functions and updated the useVectorSearch composable to use the Cloud Functions with fallback to the client-side implementation. All DataConnect dependencies and scripts have been removed from the project.

## Next Steps
1. Deploy and test Cloud Functions:
   - Deploy the Cloud Functions to Firebase
   - Test the vector search implementation with real data
   - Implement actual embedding generation using Vertex AI
   - Add more comprehensive testing for the Cloud Functions

   - Optimize vector search performance and relevance
   - Implement more advanced vector search features like filtering and faceting
   - Create a test suite for vector search functionality
   - Add support for hybrid search (combining vector and keyword search)

3. Enhance AI chat interface:
   - Improve integration with vector search capabilities
   - Add support for more complex queries and entity extraction
   - Implement conversation context and follow-up questions
   - Add better response formatting and visualization

4. Improve error handling and user experience:
   - Add comprehensive error handling for vector search operations
   - Implement loading states and progress indicators
   - Add retry mechanisms for failed API calls
   - Improve error messages for better user experience

   - Connect the chat interface to use the configured LLM providers
   - Implement fallback mechanisms when keys are not available
   - Add provider selection in the chat interface
   - Implement streaming responses for supported providers

5. Enhance LLM key management:
   - Implement key validation before saving
   - Add key usage analytics to track API usage
   - Consider adding key rotation and expiration features
   - Implement more robust error handling for encryption/decryption failures

6. Enhance AI chat interface:
