- Login, signup, and password reset functionality is working
- Protected routes with authentication middleware are implemented
- Basic dashboard for authenticated users is in place
- Firebase DataConnect schema has been designed for users, workspaces, and profiles
- DataConnect composable has been implemented for data access
- GraphQL queries and mutations have been defined in dataconnect/connector directory
- Placeholder DataConnect connector files are in place awaiting generation
- Duplicate Firebase connector dependencies identified in package.json
- Form components have been refactored into dedicated components
- Fixed readonly warnings in NeumorphicInput component
- Created reusable modal component for consistent UI
- Expanded neumorphic component library with Checkbox, Radio, and Select components
- Implemented dark mode support with theme toggle
- Created reusable page components structure
- Added DatePicker and Slider components
- Refactored dashboard to use page component
- Implemented email verification functionality
- Created user profile management with update capabilities
- Fixed component resolution warnings

- Developed a comprehensive workspaces page with filtering and pagination

## Next Steps
1. Implement vector search for AI-powered partner matching:
   - Generate the DataConnect connector code using the DataConnect CLI tool
   - Test vector embedding generation and similarity search
   - Create UI components for partner matching using vector search
   - Implement partner recommendation system based on semantic similarity

2. Implement workspace detail page:
   - Create workspace detail view
   - Add member management functionality
   - Implement workspace settings
   - Create business profile management

3. Enhance the partner matching algorithm:
   - Refine vector search parameters (method, within, etc.)
   - Implement hybrid scoring system combining vector similarity and traditional filters
   - Create partner suggestion UI with explanation of match quality

4. Enhance the UI/UX:
   - Add animations and transitions
   - Improve accessibility features
   - Implement keyboard navigation
   - Add more interactive elements

5. Add additional features:
   - Implement profile picture upload functionality
   - Add account deletion functionality
   - Create notification system
   - Implement messaging between partners

- Session: Schema and relationship patterns review

## Session Summary (2024-05-03)
In this session, we identified issues with the workspace-user relationship implementation. While workspaces are being created successfully, there may be issues with properly linking users to workspaces. We also recognized the need to review and refine our DataConnect schemas, mutations, and queries to ensure consistent relationship patterns throughout the application.

### Key Observations:
1. Vector search implementation status:
   - Basic search functionality is working for profiles, businesses, and partner preferences
   - Cross-entity matching has placeholder implementations that need to be completed
   - The useVectorSearch composable provides a clean interface but lacks distance score information
   - The VectorSearchTest component provides a user-friendly interface for testing

2. DataConnect integration:
   - Schema includes vector fields for embeddings (bioEmbedding, descriptionEmbedding, combinedEmbedding)
   - Queries and mutations are defined for vector similarity search
   - Connector code needs to be generated using the DataConnect CLI tool

3. Duplicate dependencies identified:
   - '@firebasegen/pib-connector' and '@pib/connector' both reference 'file:dataconnect-generated/js/pib-connector'
   - This could potentially cause issues and should be resolved

4. Component architecture:
   - Comprehensive neumorphic component library implemented
   - Dashboard page includes the vector search test component
   - Component-based architecture with reusable components

### Form Component Fixes:
1. Fixed issues with login and signup forms:
   - Resolved DOM warnings about non-unique IDs in input elements
   - Fixed reactivity warnings about readonly props
   - Updated the NeumorphicInput component to use computed inputId
   - Modified input event handler to check for readonly status
   - Updated form components to use explicit model-value binding with setFieldValue
   - Fixed hydration mismatches by using deterministic IDs based on input names
   - Added unique name attributes with form-specific prefixes to ensure uniqueness

## Current State
The application has implemented workspace creation functionality, but there may be issues with properly linking users to workspaces. The schema design for relationships needs review to ensure consistency with the patterns documented in systemPatterns.md.

## Relationship Pattern Issues
Based on our review of systemPatterns.md and the current implementation:
1. Some places in the code use direct ID references (e.g., workspaceId) instead of proper relationship objects
2. Queries sometimes only return IDs without the related entity data
3. Mutations may not be consistently structured for creating relationships

## Next Steps
1. Review and refine DataConnect schema:
   - Ensure all relationship fields use proper type references (e.g., `workspace: Workspace!` not `workspaceId: ID!`)
   - Verify join table definitions have proper key definitions
   - Check that all necessary relationship attributes are included

2. Update mutations:
   - Modify mutations to use proper relationship objects (e.g., `workspace: { id: $workspaceId }`)
   - Ensure consistent patterns across all entity relationships
   - Test relationship creation with the updated mutation structure

3. Enhance queries:
   - Update queries to retrieve complete related entity data when needed
   - Implement proper filtering on relationship fields
   - Test query performance with relationship data retrieval

4. Fix workspace-user relationship:
   - Debug the current issue with workspace creation but missing user linkage
   - Implement proper error handling for relationship creation failures
   - Add validation to ensure relationships are properly established

5. Resolve duplicate dependencies:
   - Consolidate '@firebasegen/pib-connector' and '@pib/connector' to use a single reference
   - Update imports throughout the codebase to use the consolidated reference
