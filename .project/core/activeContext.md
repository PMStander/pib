## Last Updated
- Date: May 5, 2024
- Session: Firebase DataConnect Emulator Integration

## Session Summary (2024-05-05)
In this session, we fixed the signup process by properly connecting to the Firebase DataConnect emulator in development mode. This resolved the 403 Forbidden errors that were occurring when trying to create user records in DataConnect after successful Firebase Authentication.

### Key Observations:
1. Authentication Flow Issues:
   - Firebase Authentication was working correctly (creating users)
   - DataConnect operations were failing with 403 Forbidden errors
   - The application was trying to use the production DataConnect service instead of the local emulator

2. Implementation Challenges:
   - Identifying the correct emulator port from firebase.json (9499)
   - Adding proper error handling for both initialization and emulator connection
   - Ensuring the emulator connection is only attempted in development mode

3. Implementation Approach:
   - Updated useFirebase.ts to connect to the DataConnect emulator in development mode
   - Added nested try/catch blocks to handle different types of errors
   - Added detailed logging to help with troubleshooting
   - Maintained consistency with how other Firebase services connect to emulators

### Implementation Details:
1. DataConnect Emulator Connection:
   - Used connectDataConnectEmulator function to connect to the local emulator on port 9499
   - Added conditional logic to only connect to the emulator in development mode
   - Improved error handling with separate try/catch blocks for initialization and emulator connection

2. Error Handling:
   - Added more detailed error logging for both initialization and emulator connection
   - Included error stack traces for better debugging
   - Ensured the application can continue even if emulator connection fails

3. Previous Session Work (LLM Key Management):
   - Implemented secure LLM key management system with AES-256-GCM encryption
   - Created UI components for managing LLM keys at user, profile, and workspace levels
   - Added support for multiple LLM providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, Ollama, XAI)
   - Implemented provider-specific configuration options

## Session Summary (2024-05-04)
In this session, we fixed authentication issues in the chat page and workspaces display issues in the workspaces tab. We also implemented an AI chat interface for interacting with the vector search functionality.

### Key Observations:
1. Authentication Issues:
   - The chat page was using onMounted to check authentication, which was too late
   - The workspaces page was using a local ref with mock data instead of app state
   - Different pages had inconsistent approaches to authentication handling

2. Implementation Challenges:
   - Ensuring consistent state management across pages
   - Fixing timing issues with data fetching
   - Integrating the chat interface with the vector search functionality

3. Implementation Approach:
   - Standardized authentication handling across pages
   - Used computed properties to access app state consistently
   - Added proper data fetching sequence to ensure data is available
   - Created a modular architecture for the chat interface

### Implementation Details:
1. Authentication Fixes:
   - Updated the chat page to use conditional rendering for authentication checks
   - Fixed the workspaces page to use the app state for workspaces data
   - Added proper data fetching in both pages
   - Improved error handling and loading states

2. Chat Interface Implementation:
   - Created a responsive chat interface with message bubbles
   - Implemented a useChat composable for managing chat state
   - Added natural language processing utilities for query understanding
   - Created response generation utilities for formatting search results

3. Navigation and Layout:
   - Created a MainNavigation component for easy access to all pages
   - Updated the default layout to include the navigation
   - Ensured responsive design for mobile and desktop
   - Added proper loading states and error handling

## Current State
The application now has proper Firebase DataConnect emulator integration for local development, which resolves the signup process issues. The Firebase Authentication system works correctly to create users, and the DataConnect emulator is properly connected to store user data, profiles, and workspaces. The application also has a secure LLM key management system that allows users to store and manage API keys for various LLM providers, and a functional AI chat interface that allows users to interact with the vector search functionality using natural language.

## Next Steps
1. Test the signup process with the DataConnect emulator:
   - Verify that user creation works correctly
   - Ensure profiles and workspaces are created properly
   - Test the entire authentication flow from signup to login

2. Improve Firebase emulator integration:
   - Add a startup script to ensure all emulators are running
   - Create better error handling for when emulators are not available
   - Add documentation for setting up the development environment

3. Integrate LLM key management with chat interface:
   - Connect the chat interface to use the configured LLM providers
   - Implement fallback mechanisms when keys are not available
   - Add provider selection in the chat interface
   - Implement streaming responses for supported providers

4. Enhance LLM key management:
   - Implement key validation before saving
   - Add key usage analytics to track API usage
   - Consider adding key rotation and expiration features
   - Implement more robust error handling for encryption/decryption failures

5. Enhance AI chat interface:
   - Improve NLP capabilities with more sophisticated techniques
   - Add support for follow-up questions and conversation context
   - Implement more advanced response generation with better explanations
   - Add support for more complex queries and entity extraction
   - Integrate with a real NLP service for better query understanding
