## Last Updated
- Date: May 7, 2024
- Session: Server API Integration for Database Operations

## Session Summary (2024-05-07)
In this session, we successfully updated the `useFirestore.ts` composable to use server API endpoints instead of direct Firestore access. This architectural improvement enhances security by ensuring all database operations go through the server API.

### Key Accomplishments:
1. Removed direct Firestore imports and dependencies
2. Updated all methods to use the `/api/data/` endpoints:
   - `read.post.ts` for fetching data
   - `write.post.ts` for creating data
   - `update.post.ts` for updating data
3. Added proper type handling and error management
4. Ensured compatibility with both camelCase and snake_case field names
5. Fixed date conversions and authentication handling

### Technical Details:
- Server API endpoints were already implemented, which made this transition smoother
- The endpoints handle authentication, data validation, vector search capabilities, and all CRUD operations
- Updated methods include:
  - `fetchCurrentUser`
  - `fetchUserProfiles`
  - `fetchUserWorkspaces`
  - `createWorkspace`
  - `createProfile`
  - `inviteToWorkspace`
  - `ensureUserExists`
  - `vectorSearch`

### Implementation Approach:
- Analyzed existing server API endpoints to understand their structure and requirements
- Updated each method in useFirestore.ts to use the appropriate endpoint
- Added proper error handling and type casting for API responses
- Ensured backward compatibility with existing code that uses the composable
- Fixed TypeScript errors and warnings

### Next Steps:
1. Test the updated functionality to ensure all operations work correctly
2. Consider updating other components that might still use direct Firestore access
3. Add comprehensive error handling for API responses
4. Continue implementing vector search capabilities for AI-data interaction

## Session Summary (2024-05-06)
In this session, we first migrated from Firebase DataConnect to Firestore due to persistent emulator issues, and then analyzed the server-side data management system to understand how to integrate it with our client-side code.

### Key Observations:
1. DataConnect Emulator Issues:
   - DataConnect emulator was crashing with SIGINT signals
   - Multiple attempts to fix the emulator issues were unsuccessful
   - Port mismatch between firebase.json (9499) and useFirebase.ts (9498) was identified but fixing it didn't resolve the issues

2. Server-Side Data Management:
   - The application has a robust server-side API for CRUD operations
   - Authentication tokens from Firebase need to be passed to the server
   - Vector search capabilities are implemented through embedding generation
   - Session management is handled through cookies

3. Implementation Approach:
   - Created a new useFirestore.ts composable that implements the same functionality as useDataConnect.ts
   - Updated useDataConnect.ts to serve as a compatibility layer that uses useFirestore.ts internally
   - Added vector search capability to both composables
   - Documented the server-side data management system for future reference

## Session Summary (2024-05-04)
In this session, we fixed authentication issues in the chat page and workspaces display issues in the workspaces tab. We also implemented an AI chat interface for interacting with the vector search functionality.

### Key Observations:
1. Authentication Issues:
   - The chat page was using onMounted to check authentication, which was too late
   - The workspaces page was using a local ref with mock data instead of app state
   - Different pages had inconsistent approaches to authentication handling

2. Implementation Challenges:
   - Ensuring consistent state management across pages
   - Fixing timing issues with data fetching
   - Integrating the chat interface with the vector search functionality

3. Implementation Approach:
   - Standardized authentication handling across pages
   - Used computed properties to access app state consistently
   - Added proper data fetching sequence to ensure data is available
   - Created a modular architecture for the chat interface

### Implementation Details:
1. Authentication Fixes:
   - Updated the chat page to use conditional rendering for authentication checks
   - Fixed the workspaces page to use the app state for workspaces data
   - Added proper data fetching in both pages
   - Improved error handling and loading states

2. Chat Interface Implementation:
   - Created a responsive chat interface with message bubbles
   - Implemented a useChat composable for managing chat state
   - Added natural language processing utilities for query understanding
   - Created response generation utilities for formatting search results

3. Navigation and Layout:
   - Created a MainNavigation component for easy access to all pages
   - Updated the default layout to include the navigation
   - Ensured responsive design for mobile and desktop
   - Added proper loading states and error handling

## Current State
The application has been successfully updated to use server API endpoints for all database operations instead of direct Firestore access. This architectural improvement enhances security by ensuring all database operations go through the server API. The server-side data management system is set up with endpoints for CRUD operations (`/api/data/write`, `/api/data/read`, `/api/data/update`) and includes embedding generation for vector search. The Firebase Authentication system works correctly to create users, and the authentication token is now properly passed to the server for authenticated operations.

## Next Steps
1. Test the updated functionality:
   - Verify that user creation works correctly through the server API
   - Ensure profiles and workspaces are created properly
   - Test the entire authentication flow from signup to login
   - Verify that vector search functionality works correctly

2. Improve error handling and user experience:
   - Add comprehensive error handling for server API responses
   - Implement loading states for all API calls
   - Add retry mechanisms for failed API calls
   - Improve error messages for better user experience

3. Improve Firebase emulator integration:
   - Add a startup script to ensure all emulators are running
   - Create better error handling for when emulators are not available
   - Add documentation for setting up the development environment

4. Integrate LLM key management with chat interface:
   - Connect the chat interface to use the configured LLM providers
   - Implement fallback mechanisms when keys are not available
   - Add provider selection in the chat interface
   - Implement streaming responses for supported providers

5. Enhance LLM key management:
   - Implement key validation before saving
   - Add key usage analytics to track API usage
   - Consider adding key rotation and expiration features
   - Implement more robust error handling for encryption/decryption failures

6. Enhance AI chat interface:
   - Improve NLP capabilities with more sophisticated techniques
   - Add support for follow-up questions and conversation context
   - Implement more advanced response generation with better explanations
   - Add support for more complex queries and entity extraction
   - Integrate with a real NLP service for better query understanding
