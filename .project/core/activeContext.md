## Last Updated

- Session: Nuxt useState Implementation for Shared State Management

## Session Summary (2024-05-03)
In this session, we implemented Nuxt's useState composable for better state management of shared data like users, workspaces, and profiles. We also fixed the issue with workspaces not showing up in the dashboard.

### Key Observations:
1. State Management Issues:
   - Workspaces were being fetched correctly but not displayed in the dashboard
   - The dashboard component was using a local ref for workspaces, which was initialized as an empty array
   - The workspaces were being updated after the component was mounted, but the component wasn't reactive to these changes

2. Nuxt's useState Advantages:
   - Provides server/client shared state
   - Ensures reactivity across components
   - Maintains state across page navigations
   - Simplifies state management with a centralized approach

3. Implementation Approach:
   - Created a new useAppState composable using Nuxt's useState
   - Updated useDataConnect to use computed properties that access the app state
   - Updated useFirebaseAuth to integrate with the app state
   - Modified dashboard and login pages to use the app state

### Implementation Details:
1. Created useAppState Composable:
   - Used Nuxt's useState for auth user, current user, profiles, workspaces, and UI state
   - Added helper methods for setting and clearing state
   - Ensured proper TypeScript typing for all state properties

2. Updated useDataConnect:
   - Changed direct refs to computed properties that access the app state
   - Updated all methods to use the app state setters instead of directly modifying refs
   - Fixed TypeScript errors and improved error handling
   - Enhanced the fetchUserWorkspaces method to correctly process the workspace data structure

3. Updated useFirebaseAuth:
   - Added integration with the app state
   - Updated the auth state listener to update the app state
   - Enhanced the sign-out method to clear the app state
   - Improved error handling and type safety

4. Fixed Dashboard Component:
   - Modified the dashboard page to use the app state for workspaces
   - Added debugging to track the workspaces data flow
   - Improved error handling for edge cases

## Current State
The application now has a robust state management solution using Nuxt's useState composable. We've fixed the issue with workspaces not showing up in the dashboard by using a centralized state store that ensures the workspaces are available to all components that need them. The state is now shared across components and pages, ensuring consistency and reactivity.

## Next Steps
1. Implement vector search for AI-powered partner matching:
   - Generate the DataConnect connector code using the DataConnect CLI tool
   - Test vector embedding generation and similarity search
   - Create UI components for partner matching using vector search
   - Implement partner recommendation system based on semantic similarity

2. Resolve duplicate dependencies:
   - Consolidate '@firebasegen/pib-connector' and '@pib/connector' to use a single reference
   - Update imports throughout the codebase to use the consolidated reference

3. Continue refining DataConnect schema:
   - Update remaining schemas to use proper type references (e.g., `workspace: Workspace!` not `workspaceId: ID!`)
   - Standardize on one join table pattern (either `WorkspaceUser` or `WorkspaceMember`)
   - Ensure all relationship fields follow the same pattern

4. Update remaining mutations:
   - Modify mutations for `BusinessProfile`, `PartnerPreferences`, etc. to use proper relationship objects
   - Ensure consistent patterns across all entity relationships
   - Test relationship creation with the updated mutation structure

5. Further enhance queries:
   - Update remaining queries to retrieve complete related entity data
   - Implement proper filtering on relationship fields for all queries
   - Test query performance with relationship data retrieval

6. Add unit tests for state management:
   - Test the useAppState composable
   - Verify state persistence across page navigations
   - Test state clearing on sign out
