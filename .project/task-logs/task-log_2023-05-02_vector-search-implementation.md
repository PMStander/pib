## Task Details
- **Goal**: Implement AI-powered vector search capabilities for semantic matching between profiles, businesses, and partner preferences using Firebase DataConnect and Vertex AI embeddings.

- **Implementation**:
  1. Fixed the DataConnect schema and queries for vector search:
     - Corrected typos in field names (partnerPreferencess vs partnerPreferences)
     - Fixed vector field queries to not include _metadata fields causing deployment errors
     - Implemented structured queries for different entity types
  
  2. Deployed the DataConnect schema with vector fields:
     - Successfully deployed schema with vector fields and required extensions
     - Set up three vector fields: bioEmbedding, descriptionEmbedding, combinedEmbedding
     - Added PostgreSQL extensions: vector, google_ml_integration, uuid-ossp
  
  3. Updated the useVectorSearch composable:
     - Fixed implementation to match the actual structure of the generated connector
     - Correctly handled API responses and error states
     - Implemented type-safe result mapping for different entity types

  4. Created a VectorSearchTest component:
     - Built an interface allowing users to test different vector search types
     - Implemented result display for profiles, business profiles, and partner preferences
     - Added contextual formatting for each result type

  5. Integrated the search component into the dashboard:
     - Added the component to the dashboard page under a dedicated section
     - Ensured consistent styling with the application's neumorphic design

- **Challenges**:
  1. The DataConnect schema deployment failed initially due to incorrect _metadata field references
  2. The generated connector code structure didn't match what was expected in the useVectorSearch composable
  3. Cross-entity matching (profile-to-business and vice versa) couldn't be fully implemented due to limitations in the current GraphQL queries

- **Decisions**:
  1. Removed _metadata fields from queries to allow successful deployment
  2. Updated the useVectorSearch composable to match the actual structure of the generated connector
  3. Implemented placeholder functionality for cross-entity matching with explanatory error messages
  4. Made the vector search component UI adaptive to different result types

## Performance Evaluation
- **Score**: 20/23
- **Strengths**:
  - Successfully implemented basic vector search for all entity types (+10)
  - Followed Vue.js and TypeScript idioms correctly (+3)
  - Built the solution with minimal, clean code (+2)
  - Created reusable vector search components that can be easily extended (+1)

- **Areas for Improvement**:
  - Cross-entity matching was not fully implemented and currently returns empty results (-2)
  - The distance metadata from vector searches is not currently displayed in the UI (-1)

## Next Steps
- Implement proper cross-entity matching by extending the GraphQL queries
- Add support for displaying distance/relevance scores in search results
- Add pagination for search results to handle larger result sets
- Create specialized UI for different search scenarios (finding partners, matching profiles)
- Test the semantic search quality with diverse real-world data
