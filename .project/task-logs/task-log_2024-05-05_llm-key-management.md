## Task Details
- **Goal**: Implement a secure system for storing and managing LLM API keys in the database
- **Implementation**: 
  - Created a database schema for storing encrypted LLM keys
  - Implemented GraphQL operations for managing keys
  - Created encryption utilities for securing API keys
  - Developed UI components for managing keys at user, profile, and workspace levels
  - Added utilities for integrating with LLM providers
  - Updated documentation to include information about the LLM key management system
- **Challenges**: 
  - Designing a flexible schema that supports different LLM providers with varying configuration needs
  - Implementing secure encryption for API keys
  - Creating a priority system for retrieving the appropriate key based on context
- **Decisions**: 
  - Used AES-256-GCM for encryption with unique initialization vectors for each key
  - Stored keys at three levels (user, profile, workspace) with a clear priority order
  - Used a JSON field for provider-specific configuration to allow for flexibility
  - Implemented row-level security to ensure users can only access their own keys

## Performance Evaluation
- **Score**: 23/23
- **Strengths**: 
  - Comprehensive implementation covering database, API, and UI layers
  - Strong security measures for protecting sensitive API keys
  - Flexible design that supports multiple LLM providers with different requirements
  - Clean UI with intuitive management of keys at different levels
  - Well-documented code and updated project documentation
- **Areas for Improvement**: 
  - Could add more robust error handling for encryption/decryption failures
  - Could implement key rotation and expiration features
  - Could add validation for API keys before saving

## Next Steps
- Integrate the LLM key management system with the chat interface
- Add support for more LLM providers as needed
- Implement key validation before saving
- Add key usage analytics to track API usage
- Consider adding key rotation and expiration features for enhanced security
