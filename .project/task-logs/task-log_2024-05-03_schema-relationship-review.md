## Task Information
- **Date**: 2024-05-03
- **Time Started**: 20:35
- **Time Completed**: 20:45
- **Files Modified**: None (review only)

## Task Details
- **Goal**: Review schema, mutations, and queries for proper relationship patterns
- **Implementation**: Identified issues with workspace-user relationships and inconsistent relationship patterns
- **Challenges**: Workspace creation works but user linkage may be incomplete
- **Decisions**: 
  - Need to follow the patterns in systemPatterns.md consistently
  - Use proper relationship objects (e.g., `workspace: { id: $workspaceId }`) instead of direct ID references
  - Ensure queries retrieve complete related entity data when needed

## Performance Evaluation
- **Score**: 20/23
- **Strengths**: 
  - Identified critical issue with relationship patterns early in development
  - Recognized the importance of consistent schema design
  - Documented clear next steps for addressing the issues
- **Areas for Improvement**: 
  - Could have caught this issue earlier during schema design
  - Need more comprehensive testing of relationship creation
  - Should implement validation to ensure relationships are properly established

## Next Steps
- Review and refine DataConnect schema to ensure proper relationship field definitions
- Update mutations to use proper relationship objects
- Enhance queries to retrieve complete related entity data
- Debug and fix the workspace-user relationship issue
- Resolve duplicate dependencies in package.json
