# Task Log: Implementing Zod Form Validation

## Task Information
- **Date**: 2024-05-02
- **Time Started**: 10:15
- **Time Completed**: 11:00
- **Files Modified**: 
  - components/neumorphic/Input.vue
  - composables/useZodForm.ts (new)
  - utils/validations/schemas.ts (new)
  - components/neumorphic/Form.vue (new)
  - pages/login.vue
  - pages/signup.vue (new)
  - docs/form-validation.md (new)

## Task Details
- **Goal**: Implement form validation using Zod and integrate it with the existing neumorphic components
- **Implementation**: 
  - Added vee-validate and @vee-validate/zod dependencies
  - Created useZodForm composable for form handling with Zod validation
  - Defined common validation schemas in utils/validations/schemas.ts
  - Enhanced NeumorphicInput component to support validation
  - Created a new Form component for form-level validation
  - Implemented example login and signup forms with validation
  - Created documentation for the form validation system
- **Challenges**: 
  - The originally planned @vueuse/zod package was not available, so we used @vee-validate/zod instead
  - Ensuring proper TypeScript integration with Zod schemas
  - Balancing validation UX (when to validate fields)
- **Decisions**: 
  - Used vee-validate as the form handling library with Zod integration
  - Enhanced existing NeumorphicInput component rather than creating a new one
  - Implemented validation on blur by default, with options for input and submit
  - Created comprehensive documentation for the validation system

## Performance Evaluation
- **Score**: 22/23
- **Strengths**: 
  - Complete implementation of form validation with Zod
  - Type-safe form handling with TypeScript integration
  - Enhanced existing components to support validation
  - Comprehensive documentation with examples
  - Example forms demonstrating validation in action
- **Areas for Improvement**: 
  - Could add more specialized form components (checkboxes, radio buttons, etc.)

## Next Steps
- Test the form validation system with real API integration
- Add more specialized form components (select, checkbox, radio)
- Implement dark mode support for the form components
- Create a business profile form with more complex validation
- Integrate form validation with Firebase authentication
