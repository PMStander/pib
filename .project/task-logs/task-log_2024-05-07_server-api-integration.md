# Task Log: Server API Integration for Database Operations

## Task Information
- **Date**: 2024-05-07
- **Time Started**: 10:00
- **Time Completed**: 12:30
- **Files Modified**: 
  - composables/useFirestore.ts
  - composables/useDataConnect.ts

## Task Details
- **Goal**: Update the `useFirestore.ts` composable to use server API endpoints instead of direct Firestore access.
- **Implementation**: 
  - Removed direct Firestore imports and dependencies
  - Updated all methods to use the `/api/data/` endpoints
  - Added proper type handling and error management
  - Ensured compatibility with both camelCase and snake_case field names
  - Fixed date conversions and authentication handling
- **Challenges**: 
  - TypeScript type issues with API responses
  - Handling both camelCase and snake_case field names
  - Ensuring backward compatibility with existing code
- **Decisions**: 
  - Used type assertions to handle API response types
  - Added support for both camelCase and snake_case field names
  - Maintained the same method signatures for backward compatibility
  - Updated the vectorSearch method to use text queries instead of raw vectors

## Performance Evaluation
- **Score**: 22/23
- **Strengths**: 
  - Successfully updated all methods to use server API endpoints
  - Maintained backward compatibility with existing code
  - Added proper error handling and type casting
  - Fixed all TypeScript errors and warnings
  - Ensured compatibility with both camelCase and snake_case field names
- **Areas for Improvement**: 
  - Could add more comprehensive error handling for API responses
  - Could add retry mechanisms for failed API calls
  - Could add more detailed logging for debugging

## Next Steps
- Test the updated functionality to ensure all operations work correctly
- Consider updating other components that might still use direct Firestore access
- Add comprehensive error handling for API responses
- Continue implementing vector search capabilities for AI-data interaction
