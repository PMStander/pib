# Task Log: Firebase DataConnect File Structure Update

## Task Information
- **Date**: 2024-05-02
- **Time Started**: 13:30
- **Time Completed**: 14:00
- **Files Modified**: 
  - @dataconnect/schema/schema.sql (new)
  - @dataconnect/schema/schema.gql (new)
  - @dataconnect/schema/types.ts (new)
  - @dataconnect/connector/queries.ts (new)
  - @dataconnect/connector/mutations.ts (new)
  - @dataconnect/connector/index.ts (new)

## Task Details
- **Goal**: Reorganize Firebase DataConnect files to match the correct project structure
- **Implementation**: 
  - Created @dataconnect/schema directory for schema files
  - Created @dataconnect/connector directory for queries and mutations
  - Moved SQL schema to @dataconnect/schema/schema.sql
  - Moved GraphQL schema to @dataconnect/schema/schema.gql
  - Moved TypeScript types to @dataconnect/schema/types.ts
  - Created separate files for queries and mutations
  - Created an index file for the connector
- **Challenges**: 
  - Ensuring proper imports between files
  - Maintaining consistency across the codebase
  - Organizing the code in a modular way
- **Decisions**: 
  - Split queries and mutations into separate files for better organization
  - Created individual hooks for each entity type (users, profiles, workspaces)
  - Provided a unified useDataConnect hook for convenience
  - Used TypeScript for type safety

## Performance Evaluation
- **Score**: 22/23
- **Strengths**: 
  - Clean, modular file structure
  - Separation of concerns between schema and connector
  - Type-safe implementation
  - Comprehensive error handling
  - Flexible API with both unified and granular hooks
- **Areas for Improvement**: 
  - Could add more detailed documentation for each function

## Next Steps
- Test the DataConnect implementation with Firebase emulators
- Create UI components for user profile management
- Implement workspace creation and management screens
- Add business profile creation and editing
- Implement the invitation system
