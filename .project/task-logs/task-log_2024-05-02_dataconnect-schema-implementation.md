## Task Information
- **Date**: 2024-05-02
- **Time Started**: 14:00
- **Time Completed**: 15:00
- **Files Modified**: 
  - dataconnect/schema/schema.sql (new)
  - dataconnect/schema/schema.gql (updated)
  - dataconnect/schema/types.ts (new)
  - dataconnect/connector/queries.gql (updated)
  - dataconnect/connector/mutations.gql (updated)

## Task Details
- **Goal**: Implement Firebase DataConnect schema for user profiles, workspaces, and their relationships
- **Implementation**: 
  - Created SQL schema for DataConnect with tables for users, workspaces, profiles, and their relationships
  - Updated GraphQL schema for DataConnect with proper table definitions and relationships
  - Created TypeScript types for all entities
  - Updated GraphQL queries for DataConnect
  - Updated GraphQL mutations for DataConnect
- **Challenges**: 
  - Understanding the correct syntax for DataConnect mutations and queries
  - Ensuring proper file structure for DataConnect files
  - Implementing the correct relationships between entities
- **Decisions**: 
  - Used a many-to-many relationship between users and workspaces via the workspace_members table
  - Implemented profiles as a separate entity that can be reused across workspaces
  - Added proper table directives and column definitions in the GraphQL schema
  - Split invitation response into separate accept and decline mutations

## Performance Evaluation
- **Score**: 21/23
- **Strengths**: 
  - Comprehensive schema design with proper relationships
  - Proper DataConnect syntax for table and column definitions
  - Well-structured queries and mutations
  - Type-safe TypeScript definitions
  - Flexible design that supports the requirements
- **Areas for Improvement**: 
  - Could add more validation rules to the schema
  - Need to test the schema with actual DataConnect operations

## Next Steps
- Test the schema with Firebase DataConnect emulator
- Implement UI components for user profile management
- Create workspace management screens
- Implement invitation system for workspaces
- Add business profile creation and management
