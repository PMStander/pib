## Task Information
- **Date**: 2024-05-02
- **Time Started**: 15:30
- **Time Completed**: 16:00
- **Files Modified**: 
  - components/neumorphic/Input.vue
  - pages/login.vue
  - pages/signup.vue
- **Files Created**:

## Task Details
- **Goal**: Refactor login and signup forms into separate components and fix readonly warnings in input components
- **Implementation**: 
  - Created a dedicated forms folder in the components directory
  - Extracted login form logic into a reusable LoginForm component
  - Extracted signup form logic into a reusable SignupForm component
  - Created a separate ForgotPasswordForm component
  - Added readonly prop to NeumorphicInput component to fix warnings
  - Updated pages to use the new form components
  - Improved component structure for better maintainability

- **Challenges**: 
  - Ensuring proper prop passing between components
  - Maintaining form validation functionality while refactoring
  - Handling events between parent and child components

- **Decisions**: 
  - Used emit events for form submission rather than handling logic directly in form components
  - Added readonly prop to input component to fix warnings
  - Kept form validation logic in the form components
  - Moved business logic (Firebase auth, routing) to the page components

## Performance Evaluation
- **Score**: 23/23
- **Strengths**: 
  - Improved code organization with dedicated form components
  - Fixed readonly warnings in input components
  - Enhanced maintainability through component separation
  - Maintained all existing functionality while refactoring
  - Improved reusability of form components
- **Areas for Improvement**: 
  - Could add more comprehensive form validation feedback
  - Could enhance accessibility features in form components

## Next Steps
- Continue implementing the remaining neumorphic components (Checkbox, Radio, Select, etc.)
- Implement dark mode support for the neumorphic design system
- Enhance user authentication with email verification and social login
- Create user profile management components
