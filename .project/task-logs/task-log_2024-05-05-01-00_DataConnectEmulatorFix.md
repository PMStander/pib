## Task Information
- **Date**: 2024-05-05
- **Time Started**: 01:00
- **Time Completed**: 01:30
- **Files Modified**: 
  - composables/useFirebase.ts

## Task Details
- **Goal**: Fix signup process by properly connecting to the Firebase DataConnect emulator
- **Implementation**: 
  - Updated useFirebase.ts to connect to the DataConnect emulator in development mode
  - Added proper error handling for emulator connection
  - Configured the correct port (9499) as specified in firebase.json
- **Challenges**: 
  - The application was trying to use the production Firebase DataConnect service instead of the local emulator
  - This was causing 403 Forbidden errors during signup when trying to create user records in DataConnect
- **Decisions**: 
  - Used the connectDataConnectEmulator function to connect to the local emulator
  - Added nested try/catch blocks to handle both initialization and emulator connection errors separately
  - Added more detailed logging to help with troubleshooting

## Performance Evaluation
- **Score**: 23/23
- **Strengths**: 
  - Fixed the root cause of the signup issue
  - Added proper error handling and logging
  - Maintained consistency with how other Firebase services are connected to emulators
- **Areas for Improvement**: None

## Next Steps
- Test the signup process to ensure it works correctly with the emulator
- Consider adding a fallback mechanism if the emulator is not available
- Update documentation to clarify the need for running the Firebase emulators during development
