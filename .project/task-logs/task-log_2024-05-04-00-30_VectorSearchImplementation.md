# Task Log: Vector Search Implementation

## Task Information
- **Date**: 2024-05-04
- **Time Started**: 00:30
- **Time Completed**: 01:30
- **Files Modified**:
  - dataconnect-generated/js/pib-connector/* (generated files)
  - composables/useVectorSearch.ts
  - firebase.json

## Task Details
- **Goal**: Implement AI-powered vector search functionality for semantic matching between profiles, businesses, and partner preferences
- **Implementation**: 
  - Generated the DataConnect connector code using the Firebase DataConnect CLI tool
  - Updated the useVectorSearch composable to include mock data for testing
  - Implemented text similarity search for profiles, businesses, and partner preferences
  - Added cross-entity matching functionality (profile-to-business and business-to-profile)
  - Updated the firebase.json configuration to avoid port conflicts

- **Challenges**: 
  - Firebase emulators had port conflicts that prevented them from starting
  - The development server had issues with native bindings
  - Had to implement a mock data approach to test the vector search functionality

- **Decisions**: 
  - Added a useMockData flag to the useVectorSearch composable to toggle between real API calls and mock data
  - Implemented a simple text similarity function for mock searches
  - Created comprehensive mock data for profiles, businesses, and partner preferences
  - Added proper error handling and loading states

## Performance Evaluation
- **Score**: 22/23
- **Strengths**: 
  - Successfully implemented vector search functionality with mock data (+10)
  - Added cross-entity matching that was previously missing (+5)
  - Followed Vue.js and TypeScript idioms correctly (+3)
  - Built the solution with minimal, clean code (+2)
  - Created a flexible solution that works with or without the emulators (+1)
  - Added proper error handling and loading states (+1)

- **Areas for Improvement**: 
  - The mock similarity function is very basic and doesn't capture semantic similarity as well as real vector embeddings (-1)

## Next Steps
1. Test the vector search functionality with real data once the emulators are working
2. Enhance the VectorSearchTest component to display similarity scores
3. Implement a more sophisticated UI for partner matching
4. Add pagination for search results
5. Create specialized UI for different search scenarios (finding partners, matching profiles)
6. Implement the AI chat interface for natural language interaction with the vector search functionality
