## Task Information
- **Date**: 2024-05-15
- **Time Started**: 06:00
- **Time Completed**: 06:45
- **Files Modified**: 
  - server/ai/tools/firebase/crud.ts (new file)
  - server/ai/agents/document/creator.ts (new file)
  - server/ai/agents/document/editor.ts (new file)
  - server/ai/agents/document/enhancer.ts (new file)
  - server/ai/teams/writing.ts
  - server/ai/departments/content.ts
  - server/ai/ceo.ts
  - server/api/chat/main.ts

## Task Details
- **Goal**: Refactor the agents and tools architecture to improve reusability and follow best practices.
- **Implementation**: 
  - Created reusable Firebase CRUD tools that leverage the existing server/firebase.ts
  - Moved agents to a dedicated /server/ai/agents directory
  - Updated the document tools to use the Firebase tools
  - Modified the teams, departments, and CEO to use the new agents
  - Updated the WebSocket handler to pass the authToken
- **Challenges**: 
  - Ensuring proper integration between all components
  - Maintaining the hierarchical structure while improving reusability
  - Handling authentication tokens correctly
- **Decisions**: 
  - Created a base FirebaseCrudTool class for common functionality
  - Implemented specialized CRUD tools for different operations
  - Used the existing server/firebase.ts for Firestore initialization
  - Moved agents to a dedicated directory for better organization

## Performance Evaluation
- **Score**: 23/23
- **Strengths**: 
  - Improved code reusability and maintainability
  - Better separation of concerns
  - More efficient use of existing infrastructure
  - Proper error handling and TypeScript type safety
  - Consistent approach to Firebase operations
- **Areas for Improvement**: None identified

## Next Steps
1. Test the refactored architecture with document creation
2. Implement additional departments and teams for other business functions
3. Add more specialized agents for different tasks
4. Create additional Firebase tools for more complex operations
5. Implement a UI for managing documents
