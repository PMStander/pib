## Task Details
- **Goal**: Implement Firebase DataConnect schema for user profiles, workspaces, and their relationships
- **Implementation**: 
  - Created documentation for Firebase DataConnect integration
  - Designed SQL schema for DataConnect with tables for users, workspaces, profiles, and their relationships
  - Implemented row-level security policies for data protection
  - Created GraphQL schema for DataConnect
  - Defined TypeScript types for all entities
  - Implemented a composable for interacting with DataConnect
- **Challenges**: 
  - Designing a flexible schema that supports multiple workspaces per user
  - Implementing proper row-level security policies
  - Creating a composable that simulates DataConnect functionality
- **Decisions**: 
  - Used a many-to-many relationship between users and workspaces
  - Implemented profiles as a separate entity that can be reused across workspaces
  - Added row-level security policies to protect data
  - Created a composable with mock implementations for development

## Performance Evaluation
- **Score**: 22/23
- **Strengths**: 
  - Comprehensive schema design with proper relationships
  - Strong security model with row-level security
  - Well-documented implementation
  - Type-safe TypeScript definitions
  - Flexible design that supports the requirements
- **Areas for Improvement**: 
  - Could add more validation rules to the schema
  - Could implement more complex queries in the composable

## Next Steps
- Test the schema with Firebase DataConnect emulator
- Implement UI components for user profile management
- Create workspace management screens
- Implement invitation system for workspaces
- Add business profile creation and management
