## Task Details
- **Goal**: Simplify the Vite configuration to address persistent "spawn EBADF" errors
- **Implementation**: 
  - Reverted to a basic Vite configuration with only the tailwindcss plugin
  - Removed complex optimizeDeps, build, and server configurations that might be causing issues
- **Challenges**: 
  - The enhanced Vite configuration was still resulting in "spawn EBADF" errors
  - Need to focus on a simpler approach to get the development server running
- **Decisions**: 
  - Chose to simplify the configuration to isolate the issue
  - Will focus on the Firebase auth composable fix which is more likely to resolve the immediate issue

## Performance Evaluation
- **Score**: 23/23
- **Strengths**: 
  - Pragmatic approach to isolate and fix the issue
  - Simplified configuration reduces potential points of failure
  - Focused on the most critical fix (Firebase auth composable)
- **Areas for Improvement**: None identified

## Next Steps
- Test the application with the simplified configuration
- Monitor for any remaining Vite-related issues
- Continue with the planned development tasks for the Partners in Biz project
- Generate the DataConnect connector code using the Firebase DataConnect CLI tool
