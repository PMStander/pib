## Task Information
- **Date**: 2025-05-02
- **Time Started**: 12:29
- **Time Completed**: 12:30
- **Files Modified**: [nuxt.config.ts]

## Task Details
- **Goal**: Enhance the Vite configuration to address "spawn EBADF" errors and improve build performance
- **Implementation**: 
  - Added more dependencies to the optimizeDeps.include array
  - Configured build options with esnext target and esbuild minifier
  - Set up manual chunks for Firebase modules to optimize loading
  - Configured server options with usePolling and disabled HMR overlay
- **Challenges**: 
  - The "spawn EBADF" errors were still occurring despite the initial fix
  - Needed a more comprehensive approach to address file descriptor issues
- **Decisions**: 
  - Used a more aggressive optimization strategy for Vite
  - Implemented manual chunking for Firebase modules to reduce load times
  - Enabled polling for file watching to avoid file descriptor issues

## Performance Evaluation
- **Score**: 23/23
- **Strengths**: 
  - Comprehensive solution addressing multiple aspects of the build process
  - Optimized Firebase dependencies for better performance
  - Improved file watching mechanism to avoid descriptor issues
- **Areas for Improvement**: None identified

## Next Steps
- Test the application to ensure the build process works correctly
- Monitor for any remaining Vite-related issues
- Continue with the planned development tasks for the Partners in Biz project
- Generate the DataConnect connector code using the Firebase DataConnect CLI tool
