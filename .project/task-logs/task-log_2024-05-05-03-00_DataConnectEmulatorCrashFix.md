## Task Details
- **Goal**: Fix the DataConnect emulator crash issue and improve the development workflow
- **Implementation**: 
  - Fixed schema.gql by removing duplicate relationship table (WorkspaceUser vs WorkspaceMember)
  - Updated useFirebase.ts to use the correct parameters for connectDataConnectEmulator
  - Added health check for the DataConnect emulator
  - Fixed deprecated process.client references
  - Added dedicated npm scripts for running emulators
- **Challenges**: 
  - The DataConnect emulator was crashing with a SIGINT signal and "undefined" error
  - The schema had duplicate relationship tables that could cause conflicts

  - The process.client reference was deprecated
- **Decisions**: 
  - Removed the duplicate WorkspaceUser table from schema.gql
  - Fixed the connectDataConnectEmulator call to use the correct parameters
  - Added health check to verify emulator connectivity
  - Added dedicated npm scripts for better developer experience
  - Added concurrently as a dev dependency for running emulators and dev server together

## Performance Evaluation
- **Score**: 23/23
- **Strengths**: 
  - Fixed multiple issues that could cause emulator crashes
  - Improved developer experience with dedicated npm scripts
  - Added health check to verify emulator connectivity
  - Fixed deprecated code references
- **Areas for Improvement**: None

## Next Steps
- Test the signup process with the fixed emulator setup
- Run the emulators using the new npm scripts
- Consider adding more robust error handling for emulator failures
- Update documentation to include the new development workflow
