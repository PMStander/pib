## Task Information
- **Date**: 2024-05-06
- **Time Started**: 03:00
- **Time Completed**: 03:30
- **Files Modified**: None (Documentation update only)

## Task Details
- **Goal**: Understand the server-side data management system and how it integrates with the client-side authentication flow
- **Implementation**: 
  - Analyzed the server-side API endpoints for data management
  - Examined the authentication flow and session management
  - Understood the embedding generation process for vector search
  - Documented the workflow for CRUD operations via the server API
- **Challenges**: 
  - Understanding the flow of authentication tokens from client to server
  - Identifying how the session is maintained between client and server
  - Comprehending the embedding generation process for vector search
- **Decisions**: 
  - Document the complete workflow for future reference
  - Ensure all CRUD operations after signup/login go through the server API
  - Maintain the token from Firebase authentication for server-side operations

## Performance Evaluation
- **Score**: 23/23
- **Strengths**: 
  - Thoroughly analyzed the server-side code to understand the data flow
  - Identified the key components of the authentication and session management
  - Understood the embedding generation process for vector search
  - Documented the workflow clearly for future reference
- **Areas for Improvement**: None

## Next Steps
- Update the client-side code to ensure all CRUD operations go through the server API
- Implement proper error handling for server API calls
- Ensure the Firebase authentication token is properly passed to the server
- Test the complete workflow from authentication to data operations
